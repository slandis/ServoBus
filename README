Serial Bus Servo Control Arduino Library

This library allows for control and maintenance of serial bus servos, specifically the LX-16A from LOBOT/LewanSoul.

The library sends and receives commands via a 115200B serial connection. In practice this needs to be a hardware serial connect, as software serial introduces a more than acceptable amount of error at this speed. Status replies from the bus are received asynchronously and utilize callbacks to hand off pertinent data.

It is recommended to use this library in conjunction with a board which contains more than one hardware serial port. While the manufacturer states that these servos are protocol-compatible with Dynamixel servos this does not bear out with a simple reading of the data sheets.

There is currently no documentation on specific functions but they are fairly self explanatory.
